# Delete test

this is a test plugin to see if we delete a post in a job or a post created action...

issue is currently that a deleted post isn't informing things that they have been deleted?

plugin deletes a topic in a job (or via an on create trigger)

post deletes successfully.... but users already loaded the content don't get updated via message bus.
